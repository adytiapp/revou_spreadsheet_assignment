						<h2>Project Summary</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Cleaned the dataset using various function in spreadsheet, particularly filter and sort function.</li>
							<li>Performed basic statistical analysis such as statistical description and data distribution analysis.</li>
							<li>Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) such as univariate and multivariate analysis to get meaningful insights.</li>
							<li>Performed advanced statistical analysis such as linear regression and hypothesis testing.</li>
					  	</ol>
						<br>

						<h2>Insights</h2>
						<ol>

					<h2>Data Scope, Goals & Objectives</h2>
					<h3>CASE 1 | <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dragonduck/property-listings-in-kuala-lumpur">Property Listings in Kuala Lumpur</a></h3>
						<p>This dataset was provided by kaggle. Originally from tabular result of scraping a property listing website for properties for sale in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Only the overview page was scraped so individual property details are scarce.</p>
					<h3>CASE 2 | <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce">Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist</a></h3>
						<p>This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.</p>
					<h3>CASE 3 | <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XZ6SjnbAs_bHGdznm8sUEYqmPbNlrMabIueGvpmxi2E/edit#gid=842283717">A/B Test Result Dataset</a></h3>
						<p>This is a classified e-commerce company data. The dataset is about test result from an experimental landing page. The dataset includes user id, timestamp, group, and converted.</p>
					<h3>Goals</h3>
						<p>Learn spreadsheets skills such as data cleaning and EDA. Those skills would be really helpful in data analysis work environment.</p>
					<h3>Objectives</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Clean the dataset using various function in spreadsheet, particularly filter and sort function.</li>
							<li>Perform basic statistical analysis such as statistical description and data distribution analysis.</li>
							<li>Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) such as univariate and multivariate analysis to get meaningful insights.</li>
							<li>Perform advanced statistical analysis such as linear regression and hypothesis testing.</li>
